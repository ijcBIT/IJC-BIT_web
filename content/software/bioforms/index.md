##  Quick Usage Overview

### For BioForm Administrators

##### Setting up a form:
- Define the required fields for your form.
- Create the template within the CEDAR ecosystem.
- Set up a SharePoint folder to store the template and grant access to the relevant users.
### For BioForm Users & Collaborators
- Your administrator will provide you with a link to your web BioForm.

  Example: www.bioforms.carrerasresearch.org/genomica
      
- Simply share this link with your collaborators so they can input the required metadata.
- Once a collaborator submits the form, youâ€™ll receive an email confirmation from SharePoint. This notification confirms whether a new file (Excel) has been uploaded or an existing file has been updated.
##### Accessing & Downloading Information
- Download the latest submission directly from the link in your confirmation email.
- To access all past submissions, navigate to the designated SharePoint folder via Office. There, you can review the full submission history and download previous files as needed.
