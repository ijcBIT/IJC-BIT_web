The analysis of the genome (DNA) enables the identification of mutations and genetic variations associated to disease and is important, for example, for personalized treatments. For cancer research this is crucial to identify driver mutations (mutated genes that accelerate tumor genesis) and understand tumor evolution (clonality analysis).

We analyze data from Whole Genome and Exome sequencing (WGS/WES), targeted sequencing, SNP panels and genotyping microarrays.

## Our analyses:

- Variant analysis (SNP, indels, copy number variation, structural variations)

- Variant annotation (predict effect on gene expression or protein function, clinical relevance)
