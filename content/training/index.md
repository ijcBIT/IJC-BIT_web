## Linux

· Introduction to Linux and the Shell (2 days)

A brief introduction to Linux and Shell programming for Beginners. Participants learn to find their way around the Linux system, handle and modify files and directories and how write (and execute) their own Shell (bash) scripts.

· The Shell advanced (1 day)

In this  course we teach advanced functionality of the Shell (specifically bash). The course is aimed at users at the Intermediate level, and we strongly recommend to attend the Beginners’ course ‘Introduction to Linux and the Shell’ beforehand. Participants will learn about bash expansions and substitutions, regular expressions and file manipulations with 'sed' and 'awk'.

· Working with high-performance computing clusters (1 day)

We provide a practical training session on how to use HPC clusters with the SLURM scheduler for scientific computation. This session is aimed at users with an Intermediate level and requires basic knowledge of Linux and Bash. We strongly recommend to attend our Beginners course ‘Introduction to Linux and the Shell’ beforehand. Participants will learn how to request resources, schedule, submit, monitor and control computational jobs.
