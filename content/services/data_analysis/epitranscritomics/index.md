Similarly to epigenomic modifications, epitranscriptomic modification are modifications to the transcriptome that do not alter the underlying RNA sequence. Studying these modification allows insight into RNA bioilogy, cellular processes and mechanism the can be important in disease.

We mainly process data from .. (iCLIP) for the study RNA binding proteins

### Our analysis:

- Peak calling

- Functional annotation peaks (RNA biotype, genes, gene region)

- Motif analysis

- Differential analysis
