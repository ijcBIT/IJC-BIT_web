## Bioinformatic workflows

Aside from our standard analyses, we develop custom workflows to fit your needs. This can be for a specific research question, an approach to be replicated (for example from a publication you have read) or an automated analysis pipeline for a new technology.

## Data management

Data management is crucial in the current information age. We help to efficiently store and manage your data to facilitate access and increase usability. We develop databases and dashboards for data visualizations, and web applications for easy interaction - all in line with FAIR data principles. Our solutions are scalable and promote seamless data integration.

## Data mining 

Public data repositories contain vast amounts of information. We generate (or validate) hypotheses (candidate gene/phenotype selection, pathway identification, etc.) using public data to support your research question.

## Data visualizations

Transforming complex data into easily interpretable visualization helps convey a message effectively. Displaying data in a genome browser, allows to explore the genomic context, while interactive visualizations enable users to engage with the data. We provide publication-ready figures, create custom genome browser sessions, and make data dynamic with Shiny applications.
