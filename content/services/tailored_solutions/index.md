summary:
  Aside from our standard analyses above, we develop custom workflows to fit your needs. This can be for a specific research question you have, an approach you want to replicate (maybe from a publication you have read) or an automated analysis pipeline you need for a new technology you have developed.

## Bioinformatic workflows

Aside from our standard analyses above, we develop custom workflows to fit your needs. This can be for a specific research question you have, an approach you want to replicate (maybe from a publication you have read) or an automated analysis pipeline you need for a new technology you have developed.

## Data management

In the current information age, data management is crucial. We help you to efficiently store and manage your data to enhance data access and increase its usability. We develop databases, dashboards for data visualizations, and web applications for easy interaction, all in line with FAIR data principles. Our solutions are scalable and promote seamless data integration.

Data mining Public data repositories contain vast amounts of information. We generate (or validate) hypotheses (candidate gene/phenotype selection, pathway identification, etc.) using public data to support your research question.

## Data visualizations

“A picture is worth a thousand words.” Transforming complex data into easily interpretable visualization helps convey your message effectively. Displaying your data in a genome browser, you can explore its genomic context, while interactive visualizations allow users to engage with the data. We provide publication-ready figures, create genome browser session with your data, and make your data dynamic with Shiny applications.
