# BioForms
BioForms is a web-based application that allows users to create customizable metadata forms based on predefined templates. These forms ensure data consistency by using controlled vocabularies and ontologies to suggest valid values. BioForms simplifies metadata entry and integrates with the CEDAR Template Editor to enable users to submit form responses. Additionally, it supports Office 365 integration, allowing responses to be exported to Excel and stored in a dedicated SharePoint site for easy access and management.

## How to Send Form Links and Receive Notifications

### 1. Create the Form:
- Define the required fields that your form needs.
- The BioForms system administrator will create the template in the CEDAR ecosystem and will add you to the dedicated SharePoint site if you are not already a member.

### 2. Sending the Form Link to Collaborators:
- You will receive a link to a specific template form from the BioForms system administrator.
- Simply forward this link to your collaborator(s). The link will look something like this:
    - Example: `www.bioforms.carrerasresearch.org/genomica`
- Collaborators can access the form directly through this link and fill in all the necessary information.

### 3. Form Submission and Notification:
- Once the collaborator submits the form, an email notification will be sent from SharePoint. This notification confirms that the new file has been uploaded or an existing file has been updated.

### 4. Accessing and Downloading Responses:
- **Latest Responses:** You can download the most recent Excel file by accessing the SharePoint site using the link provided in the email.
- **Historic Responses:** Explore all past responses by navigating to the SharePoint folder. There, you can view, download, or manage the entire history of submitted responses.

By using BioForms, you can streamline the metadata submission process, ensuring all data is captured efficiently and is easily accessible for further analysis or record-keeping.
