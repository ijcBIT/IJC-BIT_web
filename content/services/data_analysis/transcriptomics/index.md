Studying the ‘read out of the genome’, the cell’s transcriptome (RNA) allows to identify genes and pathways that are involved in specific diseases, conditions or responses to treatments. At the single cell level that can provide insight into rare cell populations and cellular trajectories. At the transcript level it allows insight into RNA diversity and cellular processes/mechanisms that in turn may vary across cell types and individuals.

We analyze data from expression microarrays (miRNA, mRNA) and various types of RNA sequencing protocols (small RNAseq, mRNA seq and single cell RNA-seq).

## Our analysis:

- Gene quantification and annotation (RNA types and abundance)

- Target prediction (miRNA)

- Cluster analysis and dimensional reduction (k-means, PCA, MDS, tSNE )

- Differential expression analysis

- Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (up/downregulated)

- Alternative splicing, transcriptomic diversity

- Detection of fusion genes

- Variant calling (RNA editing)

- Cell type deconvolution (bulk mRNA-seq)
